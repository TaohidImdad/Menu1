**HTML Descriptive Questions and Answers**

1. **What is HTML and why is it important?**
   HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard markup language used to create web pages. It structures the content on the web, allowing browsers to interpret and display text, images, videos, and links. Without HTML, web pages would not be viewable in browsers.

2. **Explain the structure of an HTML document.**
   An HTML document consists of:

* `<!DOCTYPE html>`: Declares the document type.
* `<html>`: Root element.
* `<head>`: Contains metadata, links, scripts, and title.
* `<body>`: Contains the visible content of the web page.

3. **What is the role of the `<head>` tag in HTML?**
   The `<head>` tag contains metadata about the document, such as title, character set, linked stylesheets, and scripts. Content in the `<head>` tag is not visible on the web page but is essential for configuring how the page is processed.

4. **What is the difference between block-level and inline elements?**
   Block-level elements take up the full width available and start on a new line (e.g., `<div>`, `<p>`, `<h1>`). Inline elements take up only as much width as needed and do not start on a new line (e.g., `<span>`, `<a>`, `<strong>`).

5. **Explain the purpose of the `<a>` tag.**
   The `<a>` tag defines a hyperlink, which is used to link from one page to another. The `href` attribute holds the URL of the destination page. Example: `<a href="https://www.example.com">Visit Example</a>`.

6. **What are semantic HTML elements? Give examples.**
   Semantic HTML elements clearly describe their meaning in a human- and machine-readable way. Examples include:

* `<article>`: Independent content.
* `<section>`: Thematic grouping of content.
* `<nav>`: Navigation links.
* `<footer>`: Footer section of a page.

7. **What is the use of the `<form>` tag in HTML?**
   The `<form>` tag is used to collect user input. It can contain form elements such as text fields, radio buttons, checkboxes, submit buttons, and more. Data collected can be sent to a server for processing.

8. **What is the difference between `<id>` and `<class>` attributes?**

* `id`: Unique identifier for an element. Used when you want to target one specific element.
* `class`: Can be shared by multiple elements. Used to apply the same style or behavior to multiple elements.

9. **What are HTML attributes? Give examples.**
   Attributes provide additional information about elements. They are always specified in the start tag. Examples:

* `href` for `<a>`: `<a href="url">`.
* `src` for `<img>`: `<img src="image.jpg">`.
* `alt` for images: `<img alt="Description">`.

10. **What is the difference between HTML and HTML5?**
    HTML5 is the latest version of HTML with new elements, attributes, and behaviors. Differences include:

* New semantic elements like `<article>`, `<section>`, `<nav>`.
* Support for audio and video tags.
* Better error handling.
* Local storage and offline capabilities.
* Improved support for mobile devices and modern web apps.
